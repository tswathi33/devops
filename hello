Here’s the simplest Hello World program in C:

#include <stdio.h>  

int main() {  
    printf("Hello, World!");  
    return 0;  
}

 Breakdown:

#include <stdio.h> → Adds standard input/output functions (needed for printf)

int main() → Main function where execution starts

printf() → Prints text to screen

return 0; → Ends program successfully


Want me to also show how the flowchart of this program would look?
